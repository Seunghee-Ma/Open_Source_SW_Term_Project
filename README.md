However, it is important to note that any associated costs incurred in this process must be borne by the applicant.


## Purpose
This project was initiated in response to the need for privacy protection while accessing CCTV footage. The goal is to utilize the concepts learned in class, particularly leveraging OpenCV, to apply mosaic to individuals in images or videos.
